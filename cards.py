# Additional challenges:
# Tab in the phone number and position elements.
# Try to split the motto into multiple lines if it's longer than the bars at the top and bottom of the card.
# Try to make the name centered. There are various ways to do this, and none of them are easy - most involve using the len() function somewhere.
